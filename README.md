<h1>Optimized Deep Isolation Forest</h1>

This repository contains the official implementation of the <b>Optimized Deep Isolation Forest</b> method as proposed in the manuscript entitled 'Optimized Deep Isolation Forest'.

<h2>How to use?</h2>

Please clone the repository and execute the 'main.py' file to obtain examples of the execution times and memory usage of the <b>Optimized Deep Isolation Forest</b> method. The results will be placed in the 'results' directory.

To directly use the <b>Optimized Deep Isolation Forest</b>, you should work with the implementation from the DeepIF class located along the path 'algorithms/DeepIF.py'.

<h2>Datasets details</h2>

The datasets used in the algorithm evaluation originate from the Outlier Detection DataSets (ODDS) library.
